    "This assignment will give you practice with regular expressions (and other Python skills) by processing data on cumulative case counts and deaths in every county/parish in the US for covid-19. These data are compiled and updated regulary by the NY Times, and made available on GitHub: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data. I downloaded the data on March 30th and have included that file (covidData_3.30.20.txt) in this week's repository.\n",

To submit your assignment, please create your own folder (with your name) inside the assignments folder for this week. In this folder, please put the completed notebook and the new files you created. Please submit these via a pull request to the class GitHub page, as with previous weeks.\n",
